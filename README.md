# Dense Extreme Inception Network: Towards a Robust CNN Model for Edge Detection (DexiNed)

```diff
- Sorry for any inconvenience, we are updating the repo

This work presents a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) arquitecture for edge detection. Unlike of the state-of-the-art CNN based edge detectors, this models has a single training stage, but it is still able to overcome those models in the edge detection datasets. Moreover, Dexined does not need pre-trained weights, and it is trained from the scratch with fewer parameters tunning.
